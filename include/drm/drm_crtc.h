	 *    atomic commit. In that case the event can be send out any time
	 *    after the hardware has stopped scanning out the current
	 *    framebuffers. It should contain the timestamp and counter for the
	 *    last vblank before the display pipeline was shut off.
	 *
	 *  - For a CRTC which is enabled at the end of the commit (even when it
	 *    undergoes an full modeset) the vblank timestamp and counter must
	 *    be for the vblank right before the first frame that scans out the
	 *    new set of buffers. Again the event can only be sent out after the
	 *    hardware has stopped scanning out the old buffers.
	 *
	 *  - Events for disabled CRTCs are not allowed, and drivers can ignore
	 *    that case.
	 *

	 * Drivers are free to implement their own vblank counter and timestamp
	 * tracking though, e.g. if they have accurate timestamp registers in
	 * hardware.
	 *
	 * For hardware which supports some means to synchronize vblank
